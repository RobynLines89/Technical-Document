        <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.</p> 
        <p>This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>

        <p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its developer intends. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.</p>

        <header id="Hello_World">Hello World</header>

        <p>What is HTML?</p>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
        <code>
          My cat is very grumpy
        </code>  
        <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (< p>) element:</p>
        <code>
          < p>My cat is very grumpy< /p>
        </code>  
      </section>  
      <section class="main-section" id="Heading_and_Paragraphs">
        <header id="Heading_and_Paragraphs">Heading and Paragraphs</header>
        <p>Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.</p>
        <p>Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.</p>
        <p>In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a <p> element, like so:</p>
        <code>
          < p > I am a paragraph, oh yes I am. < /p>
        </code>
        <p>Each heading has to be wrapped in a heading element:</p>
        <code>
          < h1 > I am the title of the story. < /h1>
        </code> 
        <p>There are six heading elements: < h1>, < h2>, < h3>, < h4>, < h5>, and < h6>. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; < h1> represents the main heading, < h2> represents subheadings, < h3> represents sub-subheadings, and so on.</p>
